try to figure out:
* which planet has the highest population

* which region has the most grasslands?


## Guidelines

- Try to take an Object oriented aproach first.
- Consider the advantages and disadvantages of OO in this case.
- If possible try no prepare your code to work with real astronomical size datasets. 
- You may want to explore possibilities beyond parsing csv files with your own code. ;)
